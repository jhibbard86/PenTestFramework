Aircrack-ng is a Kali Linux tool suite that attacks Wifi WEP and WPA/2 encryption.

Start your device in Monitor Mode:

    airmon-ng start (iface) (channel)

Depending on what version of Kali you have, airmon-ng may differ, if the above does not work then try; # airmon-ng (iface) mode monitor.

Begin Packet Capture:

    airodump-ng -c (channel) --bssid (bssid) -w (file name) (iface)

On the top right section of you terminal you should see the 4-way handshake capture:

Start aircrack to begin brute forcing the 4-way handshake:

    aircrack-ng -b (bssid) -w (wordlist file) (filename of capture)

If you do not see any handshakes you may need to use a deauth attack:

    aireplay-ng -0 1 -a (bssid) -c (client MAC) (iface)

Iface = most likely wlan0, but could be different depending on your setup, either way it is your wireless card.

Filename = Just a generic name for the information that you are collecting into a pcap file.

Wordlist file = I use rockyou.txt, but you can use any definition list.

Filename of capture = This is the file that you saved earlier that created the pcap file.

It might be necessary to conduct a deauthentication attack because you will need to observe the 4-way handshake process.  If your target is already associated to an AP then you wont see it, so you essentially kick him off and watch him reestablish a connection.

After you are successful in finding the password, you can take that password and input it into wireshark to view layer 3 data.
