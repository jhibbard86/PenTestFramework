## Gobuster

<details>

### Introduction
Gobuster is a brute force directory and DNS subdomain enumeration tool that is significantly faster than dirb as it is a multithreaded tool and contains more options for searching through directories. One benefit for time management that this tool provides is that unlike dirb, it does not recursively search through found directories (which can be seen as a pro or con, depending on your needs).

### Installation

All of the Gobuster installation files are located at https://github.com/OJ/gobuster, however some prerequisites are needed.

#### Prerequisites

Since Gobuster is written in the Go language, it can be run on any system with Go installed.

#### Windows and MacOS

[Go Download](https://golang.org/dl/)

For Windows and MacOS, the installation of the Go language couldn’t be simpler, download the package from the link above that fits your system, and install away.

#### Linux

For most Linux operating systems, the Go language is already listed in their default repositories, and can be installed with the following (shown example is for Debian non-root user, use your distribution equivalent):
sudo apt-get install golang

### Gobuster

#### Windows and MacOS

In windows and MacOS, gobuster can be installed with the following without any additional changes to the PATH:

    go get github.com/OJ/gobuster

#### Linux

To install gobuster in Linux, you can either download the package from the GitHub, extract it, and reconfigure the Go PATH variables, or run the following

    sudo apt-get install gobuster

This will install gobuster and allow it to be run through the CLI directly rather than going through the Go tool. 

#### Running Gobuster

There are three different modes that gobuster can be run with, dir, dns, and vhost, each come with a separate set of options that allows for customized searches. While there are switches directly related to the different modes of gobuster, there are a few global switches as well that will work in all the modes. The three main global switches that would most likely be used are the –o (output to file), -w (wordlist file), and -t (thread count). While the first two are straight forward, the –t switch allows the user to change the amount of concurrent threads being run by gobuster. By changing the thread count, the speed of the scan can be increased or decreased (10 is the standard, 200 is the max). By using the highest count, the scan will be shorter in duration but may cause some directories to not be found.

In addition to downloaded wordlists, gobuster can also work with a piped wordlist as well. This can be done by providing a stdin to gobuster and using the reference - for the wordlist switch location as seen below.

    hashcat -a 3 --stdout ?l | gobuster dir -u https://mysite.com -w -
    Dir

The directory mode for the tool is similar to using dirb to brute force directory names from a wordlist. However, gobuster can be modified to identify directories that give out different status codes. For example, dirb does not report back directories with status code 403 (Forbidden), but it is recognized by gobuster. This can be useful as you now know that a forbidden file is there, but cannot be accessed directly with the current privileges.

Figure 1 - Gobuster directory mode switches

#### DNS

The DNS mode for dirbuster is a subdomain enumeration tool (subdomain.domain.com). To use this mode, only the –d (domain name) and –w (wordlist) switches need to be specified, however using the –i (ip address) switch can be helpful as it displays the IP address associated with the subdomain, which may increase the number of potential targets for future enumeration or exploiting. 

![Gobuster dns mode switches](gobuster_2.png)

Figure 2 - Gobuster DNS mode switches

#### VHost

The last mode option for gobuster is the virtual host enumeration. This mode allows the user to scan the target for any additional virtual hosts that may be running on the web server.  
 
![Gobuster vhost mode switches](gobuster_3.png)

Figure 3 - Gobuster VHost mode switches

#### Example Usage

For gobuster to run a directory search, only the –u and –w flags need to be specified. Using the OWASPBWA machine as the example target, gobuster will brute force the site and find the first level of directories and pages listed on the site. 
 
![Gobuster OWASP BWA](gobuster_4.png)

Figure 4 - Example of dir mode usage on the OWASP BWA machine

For the DNS scan, we will use the website hackthissite.org. Gobuster seems to have issues pulling in external websites when specifying the domain as an IP address, so a website with a real domain name was used.

![Gobuster hackthissite](gobuster_5.png)
 
Figure 5 - Example of dns mode usage on the website hackthissite.org

From the scan, four subdomains were found. With this information, further enumeration or target analysis can be used to identify the system and processes that might be running on the web server. This scan was tried with various amount of thread counts, and it appears the higher the thread count, the more likely false positives will appear.

## Netcat

<details>

Netcat is a simple tool used to communicate over a given port between a client and a server on a network. The command can be used to send messages or files over tcp or udp. There must be a server listening and a client sending for successful communication. It can be used in conjunction with other utilities to provide a pipeline over which an exploit can be used or deeper discovery can be achieved.

### Start Listener on the Target

``nc -l -p [port]``

### Start Client on Kali

``nc [target_ip_address] [port]``

Now you can send text to the target console session

### Push file from attacker to victim

On Victim:

``nc -lvp [port] > [destination path]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] < [path and name of file]``

### Pull file from victim

On Victim:

``nc -l -p [port] < [path and filename]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] > [path and name of file]``

### Port Scanning

``nc -z -v [targetip] [port or port range]``

### Banner Grab

``nc [ipaddress] [port]``

</details>

## TCPDump
<details>

TCP Dump is a packet capture utility. It watches traffic on the given interface and streams packet capture to a pcap file. This pcap file can be analyzed in Wireshark. When used in conjunction with netcat, tcpdump can provide pcap files of a victim to a remote attacker.

``tcpdump -i eth0 -w [filename.pcap]``

## NMap
<details>

Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

[NMap Cheatsheet](https://hackertarget.com/nmap-cheatsheet-a-quick-reference-guide/)

[Nmap Documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html)

[NMap Legal Issues](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html)

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses
raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions)
they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators
find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports table".  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in Example 1. The only Nmap arguments used in this example are -A, to enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute; -T4 for faster execution; and
then the hostname.

### DNSEnum

Enumerates DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.

#### OPERATIONS:

* Get the host’s addresse (A record).
* Get the namservers (threaded).
* Get the MX record (threaded).
* Perform axfr queries on nameservers and get BIND VERSION (threaded).
* Get extra names and subdomains via google scraping (google query = “allinurl: -www site:domain”).
* Brute force subdomains from file, can also perform recursion on subdomain that have NS records (all threaded).
* Calculate C class domain network ranges and perform whois queries on them (threaded).
* Perform reverse lookups on netranges ( C class or/and whois netranges) (threaded).
* Write to domain_ips.txt file ip-blocks.

## Sparta
<details>

[Sparta Documentation](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/sparta)

Sparta is a utility that automates active discovery. It starts by running nmap scans of a given ip range. Sparta will then run other various tools based on the services discovered. 

Sparta can be found in the menu under vulnerability analysis

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

When sparta opens, click in the left pane to add hosts
 
![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

Enter a network range in CIDR notation or a single ip

Sparta will begin running an nmap discovery of the scope.

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)

Results for each tool by host can be found by choosing the different tabs at the top of the right pane

![sparta 1](media/sparta_1.png)
 
Tools like nikto are ran automatically when a host is found to have a web server running on it.

Sparta is a great tool to use in place of manual nmap scans since you can start a scan job and come back to a set of comprehensive active discovery results without having to individually run each utility based on your initial manual nmap scan.
