This is an open source vulnerability scanning tool.

    Apt update 

Then

    Apt install openvas
    Openvas-setup

Copy the long password at the very end

    Openvas-start

To make sure openvas is running and find the port the webserver is running on:

    netstat -antp

Look for the port for process __gsad__

Open a web browser and browse to ``https://127.0.0.1:<gsad port number>``
