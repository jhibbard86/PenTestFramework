MAC Address: Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier for hardware.  This piece of hardware is usually a wireless card or ethernet card.  Packets are sent and received through a combination of IP, next hop, ARP, and your MAC address is mixed in there somewhere.

Macchanger comes standard on any Kali Linux suite.  Macchanger tool is performed on command-line interpreter (CLI) and must be performed in either root or super user ``sudo`` privileges.  Open up terminal and follow the steps below.

``Ifconfig``

This brings up your network adapters, as you can see here eth0 that has an assigned MAC address.  If you are connected via WiFi then you should see wlan0.

``Macchanger -s eth0``

This will bring up your current and permanent MAC, as you can see it is the same as assigned on ifconfig as the MAC has not been changed yet.

``Ifconfig eth0 down``

This is a necessary step before changing your MAC.  Disable your network adapter.  If you receive an error while attempting to change your MAC, the likely cause is that you did not disable the network adapter.  As you can see on the top right, the network was disconnected.

``Macchanger -r eth0``

Your permanent MAC will always show you your original MAC and with this command a random MAC was assigned as your new MAC address.

``Ifconfig eth0 up``
``Macchanger -s eth0``

Once you have successfully changed your MAC, you will need to bring your network adapter back on-line, afterwards check you that your new assigned MAC has been applied.

``Ifconfig``

For additional verification you can perform ifconfig to see under eth0 that your newly assigned MAC address is now what will be presented in public.

``Ifconfig eth0 down``
``Macchanger -m 00:a0:01:b1:02:c2 eth0``

To set a specific MAC which can be used as MAC spoofing, use this command which will show up as your new MAC.  Make sure to disable the network adapter before changing your MAC.

``Ifconfig eth0 up``
``-macchanger -s eth0``

Bring your network adapter back on-line.  Verify that your specific MAC has been applied successfully.

``Macchanger -l``

This command will provide you with a list of OUI``s which can be helpful to mask your new MAC with an address that resembles a realistic MAC from an official manufacturer.

``Macchanger –help``

Like most Kali linux CLI, there are other options available, all you have to do is ask for help.  You can revert your changed MAC address to the original with –p or you can simply shut down or restart your computer and your MAC will revert to the permanent automatically.
