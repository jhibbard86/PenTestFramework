[Sparta Documentation](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/sparta)

Sparta is a utility that automates active discovery. It starts by running nmap scans of a given ip range. Sparta will then run other various tools based on the services discovered.

Sparta can be found in the menu under vulnerability analysis

Enter a network range in CIDR notation or a single ip

Sparta will begin running an nmap discovery of the scope.

Results for each tool by host can be found by choosing the different tabs at the top of the right pane

Tools like nikto are ran automatically when a host is found to have a web server running on it.

Sparta is a great tool to use in place of manual nmap scans since you can start a scan job and come back to a set of comprehensive active discovery results without having to individually run each utility based on your initial manual nmap scan.
