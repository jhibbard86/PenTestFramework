TCP Dump is a packet capture utility. It watches traffic on the given interface and streams packet capture to a pcap file. This pcap file can be analyzed in Wireshark. When used in conjunction with netcat, tcpdump can provide pcap files of a victim to a remote attacker.

``tcpdump -i eth0 -w [filename.pcap]``
